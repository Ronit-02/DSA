## Subarray / Subsequence / Subset

eg. [1,2,3,4]  
- Subarray : [1,2],[1,2,3] - is continuous and maintains relative order of elements
- Subsequence: [1,2,4] - is not continuous but maintains relative order of elements
- Subset: [1,3,2] - is not continuous and does not maintain relative order of elements
